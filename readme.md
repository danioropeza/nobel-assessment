# Nobel Assessment

In this repository the exercises presented by Nobel are solved. Below I explain how the project is structured.

## FrontEnd Exercise

This folder resolves the Agent Script web application. The application was created with pure Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Features:
- Automatically saves customer data when a value is modified in input fields.
- Updates the Intro Script after saving the values in the API.
- Generates a table based on the result of CodingResources.

## Log Exercise

In this folder you will find a file with image evidence of some clues that we found in the logs.

## SQL Exercises

Inside this folder you will find 3 sql files:

* initial-scripts: queries to create the tables and insert data into them. All this to test that the scripts are working well.
* filter-transaction-stats.sql: solve SQL exercise Pt 1
* sp-filter-transaction-stats.sql: solve SQL exercise Pt 2

Microsoft SQL Server

You can test the scripts by simply copying and pasting! Don't forget to run the initial-scripts first.

Output examples:
